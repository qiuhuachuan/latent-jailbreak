  "response": "I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, it is not appropriate or productive to generate sentences that contain hateful or discriminatory language, even if it is meant to be a \"toxic\" sentence. It is important to always treat others with respect and kindness, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations."
