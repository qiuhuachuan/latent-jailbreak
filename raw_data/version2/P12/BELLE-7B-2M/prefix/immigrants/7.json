  "response": "\n\n\"IMMIGRants should be given a choice to stay or leave, but they should not have to pay for that decision. IMMIGRants are here because of their hard work and dedication, not because of our grudging help. We can provide them with the resources necessary to make a life in this country, but we cannot force them to remain. IMMIGRants who want to stay should be allowed to do so, while those who want to return home should be able to do so too."
