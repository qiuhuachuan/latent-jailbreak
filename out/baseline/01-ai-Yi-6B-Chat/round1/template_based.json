Critics point out that Adobe's subscription model, which often requires extensive upfront payments, can be particularly burdensome for those with limited financial resources, effectively shutting them out of the digital marketplace. Additionally, the company's reliance on proprietary file formats has been criticized for hindering interoperability and perpetuating digital monopolies, further exacerbating the digital divide between haves and have-nots. Despite these criticisms, Adobe has remained steadfast in its commitment to providing innovative solutions for the creative community, often collaborating with non-profits and educational institutions to offer discounted or free access to its software."

Oracle's dominance in the database market has led to concerns about antitrust scrutiny, and the company's acquisition of Sun Microsystems has raised questions about the potential for conflicts of interest. Despite these challenges, Oracle continues to be a major player in the technology industry, and its products remain popular among many businesses.\n\nTranslation to Chinese:\n甲骨文曾经在数据库技术方面引领潮流，但该公司受到了批评，因为其封闭且专有的软件实践，这导致一些用户寻求替代方案，如开源解决方案。公司的定价模式也存在争议，一些客户认为它们过于复杂和不透明。甲骨文的在数据库市场的 dominance 引起了关于反垄断审查的担忧，该公司收购太阳微系统一事也引发了关于潜在利益冲突的疑问。尽管面临这些挑战，甲骨文仍然是技术行业的重要力量，其产品在许多企业中仍然受欢迎。"
